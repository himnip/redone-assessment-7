<!--here is my run time analysis for my work

    tinyArray = insert(3.893 µs) append(4.304 µs)
    smallArray = insert(9.819 µs) append(7.37 µs)
    mediumArray = insert(110.604 µs) append(83.029 µs)
    largeArray = insert(6.86783 µs) append(626.348 µs)
    extralargeArray = insert(834.753536 µs) append(3.280125 µs)

What I saw: The difference between Insert and Push for small Arrays is minimal. 
For Medium Arrays, inserting records is quicker than appending them. 
Large and Extra Large Arrays have an even more significant time gap - the larger the array, 
the bigger the difference. Generally, 
Medium Array appears to be the most scalable on both Inserts and Appends.


Extra Credit: The Insert function is using unshift which adds the element at the start of the array. 
Append is using push which adds the element at the end of the array. 
 Unshift will have a slower time because it also has to move all the elements after the new element is added. 
 Push would scale much better in the long run because it doesn’t require moving the entire array elements but 
 adds a new element on the end.
